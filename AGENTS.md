# primedash — Coding Agent Notes

## What this is
A static “terminal dashboard” (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) with local timekeeping and a zip upload UI.

## Run
- Open `index.html` in a browser (or serve via any static server).

## Conventions
- Keep it framework-free and deployable as static files.
- Maintain the current file upload and local persistence behavior; don’t introduce a backend unless requested.
- Keep the terminal aesthetic in `styles.css` while preserving accessibility (labels, keyboard flow).
